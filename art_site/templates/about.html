            Felicity Gunn is a senior at Ohio University and plans to graduate in May of 2020 with a BFA in 
            studio art, a minor in business and a museum studies certificate. Felicityâ€™s art explores the 
            dynamic nature of line in combination with texture, form and value. Some of her favorite art 
            forms include pen and ink drawings, screen print, letterpress, book art, and mono print. Her 
            content explores subject matter such as architecture, plants, and landscape, as well as a focus on 
            design through type and visual compositions made from letterforms.
